## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone `https://github.com/ihjasfak/acme-widget-basket.git`
cd acme-widget-basket

### 2. Import the Database

Create a database (e.g., `acme_basket`) and import the schema:
mysql -u your_user -p acme_basket < db/schema.sql

### 3. Run the App

Use PHP's built-in server:
php -S localhost:8000

Access the app at: `http://localhost:8000`


## 📦 Example Offers Supported

### ✅ Buy One, Get Second at Half Price (BOGO 50%)

{
  "type": "bogo",
  "product_id": 1,
  "min_quantity": 1,
  "discount_type": "percentage",
  "discount_value": "50.00",
  "description": "Buy one get half second"
}


### ✅ Percent Discount on Minimum Quantity

{
  "type": "percentage",
  "product_id": 2,
  "min_quantity": 10,
  "discount_type": "percentage",
  "discount_value": "25.00",
  "description": "25% discount on selected item"
}


## 📬 Delivery Rules Example

Delivery charges are based on total cart value:

| Min Amount | Max Amount | Delivery Cost |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| 0          | 50         | \$4.95        |
| 50         | 90         | \$2.95        |
| 90+        | ∞          | Free          |


## 🧪 Assumptions

* Cart is stored client-side using `localStorage`
* Offers are mutually independent and can stack
* All products are uniquely identified by either `product_id` or `product_code`
* Delivery rules are fetched from the backend


## 📌 Future Improvements

* Backend offer validation for extra safety
* Auth and user sessions
* Admin panel for managing products and offers
* Checkout with payment gateway
